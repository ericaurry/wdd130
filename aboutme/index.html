    <h2>Erica Urry</h2>
    <p>I love stories. All kinds. In any form. This means I am a bibliophile and a cinephile. Recently, I found a Thai film called <i>Happy Old Year</i>. It was about a woman who wanted to live with less. But the more she physcially decluttered her life, the more she found clutter in her relationships. It was a fascinating take on minimialism. Perhaps objects hold more meaning than we acknowledge!</p>
    <p>I won't keep reviewing movies here, but I do find great meaning in the stories we tell. An introduction is a story. How much am I witholding? How much should we share? What is the perfect balance to tell a complete stranger, especially over the internet? I've shared so many intros this week in all my classes, but I don't think it gives a true picture. But maybe, just maybe, I'm revealing all about myself in this short paragraph. </p>
    <p>Please enjoy the above picture of me in high peak pandemic fashion. It was a time I didn't have a single care about how I looked. I would still love that time of not caring about my appearance, minus the pandemic part.</p>
